## React Challenge

Welcome to the JS4J coding challenge!

We appreciate your time in completing this exercise. It is an important part of our process and a great way for you to demonstrate your development skills to us. It also means we can create a more meaningful learning track for you upon your completion. 

How does the coding challenge work?
  *	You'll need to set aside a couple of hours.
  *	Carefully read the instructions below. They are quite detailed so you might need to read them more than once or refer to them as you go.
  *	Complete the exercise and show us your programming skills and thought processes.
  *	When we see your pull request we'll acknowledge it. Then we'll review it.

Have fun! We look forward to seeing your work.

## Instructions

_Please read these instructions carefully before you start and come back to read them again as you progress through the challenge._

  1. **You are welcome to use any resources you have available.** You'll have them available on the job, so why not here? Using resources well is a good thing, so tell us about the resources you have used by adding  a comment in your code .
  2. We want to see how you **work through the trello cards**.
  3. Choose a time when **you can work for two hours uninterrupted and without distractions**. We'll check the timestamps on your commits to get a feel for how long things took. If you get interrupted, that will throw your times off, so please try to work steadily for two hours.
  4. You can put in more time if you want to, but **two hours is the recommended time**. You don't have to finish the features - in fact, you are unlikely to. Get as far as you can in the time you have available.
  5. Do the best work you can. **It's not just about the code.** Show us all your moves! We'll be looking at the big picture: What's your thinking pattern? What attention do you give to others? How well would you work with others? And more.
  6. **Document! Document! Document!** Use comments in the code to explain your thinking: What made you choose this way? What kinds of things are you looking out for? Did you consider any other ways? If so, what made you reject them? Help us to get to know the real you and your thinking. 

**Note:** Using resources is wise; copying and pasting large amounts of code or having someone else do the work for you isn't: we want to get to know _your_ coding ability, not your friends.

## The challenge

**Complete as many features from the provided trello board as you are comfortable doing.** It's up to you which cards you tackle first. They are written as user stories, so there is some freedom on how you choose to complete them.

## Requirements

You'll need:
- A GitHub account
- A modern web browser (we are using the latest version of Chrome)

## Procedure

### Code Sandbox Setup

1. Open up this repository in [Code Sandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/ullibodnar/Not-a-Test).
2. Sign in with your GitHub account (top right corner), if it asks you for permission, hit accept.
3. Fork the sandbox, top left button. Making clicking noises is encouraged ;)

### Trello Setup

1. Open our [trello board](https://trello.com/b/LQfNenXm).
2. Click show menu (top right corner), and click copy board. 
3. Give it a title (JS4J your-name-here) **make sure 'Keep Cards' checkbox is checked**. 
4. From here, you are free to move cards you are currently working on to the 'Doing' column.

### Coding!!!

1. Pick a card, _any card_ to tackle. 
2. Start coding in your Code Sandbox repo!
3. Repeat steps 1-2 until your two hours are expended.
4. **Document your thinking.** (Use comments in the code, preferably). Help us to understand why you went the route you did.

### Final Steps

1. After a couple of hours work, give or take, find a point where you can stop&mdash;don't worry if you haven't finished the feature!&mdash;and use the save button to **save your work**.
2. _Did we mention documenting your reasoning for your decisions?_ Make sure you've documented it well.
10. When you're sure you're ready, **zip up your files and put them somewhere where we can find them**. Dropbox? Your own GitHub account? Include a note telling us what you did and why. Make sure to include anything you want us to consider when reviewing your code.
